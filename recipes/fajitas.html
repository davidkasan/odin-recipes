                <p class="opening"><em>A chipotle is a smoke-dried ripe jalapeño chili pepper and comes in different
                        forms: from powder to
                        flakes,
                        marinades, and sauces. It's a great way to season your dish and to give it a delicious spicy,
                        smoky
                        flavour.
                        The diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are what make these plant-based fajitas spicy and
                        taste so
                        incredible!</em></p>

            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the oil to a large pan or cast iron skillet on high heat. When hot, add the onion, garlic,
                        and salt,
                        and
                        let cook for 4 - 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the onion and garlic cook, thinly slice the bell peppers.</li>
                    <li>Returning to the pan, drop the heat to medium-high, and add the bell peppers, along with the
                        mock
                        "chicken"
                        pieces, and the spices: cumin, oregano, paprika, chili powder, and black pepper. Cook this for
                        another 5
                        minutes, or until the bell peppers have softened, but are still crunchy. Add small splashes of
                        water as
                        needed to deglaze the pan and to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat a separate large pan or skillet on the stove on medium-high heat, and place the
                        flour
                        (or
                        corn) tortillas on top in a single layer. Let these warm up for about 10 seconds on each side,
                        or until
                        it's
                        lightly toasted.</li>
                    <li>Returning to the bell peppers, add the diced chipotle sauce. Note the chipotle sauce is spicy,
                        so add
                        less
                        if you'd prefer less heat. Cook for an extra 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To assemble the fajitas, top the tortillas with a generous amount of the cooked bell pepper
                        mixture,
                        along
                        with your desired toppings. Be sure to squeeze some fresh lime juice over top, and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul class="notes">
                    <li>* If your local grocery store doesn't have vegan mock "chicken" pieces, you could use mushrooms,
                        thinly
                        sliced, that can be added at the same time as the onions, as the mushrooms need longer to cook.
                        Alternatively, for more protein, you can add some cooked beans or lentils.</li>
                    <li>** If your grocery store doesn't carry diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, consider swapping
                        it out
                        for a
                        whole chopped tomato (or some tomato passata) with a bit of smoked paprika powder to achieve a
                        similar
                        flavour. Alternatively, you can add a hot sauce of your choosing (such as Tabasco).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Storage</h4>
                <ul class="storage">
                    <li>Store the fillings separate from the tortillas in an airtight container in the fridge for up to
                        4 days.
                    </li>
