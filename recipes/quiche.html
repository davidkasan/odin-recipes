                <p class="opening"><em>This vegan quiche is so easy to make and packed with delicious flavor. It’s the
                        best thing for
                        breakfast
                        or
                        brunch and you’ll love the combination of spinach and leeks!</em></p>

                <p class="opening">You actually won’t believe how easy it is to make a vegan quiche. If you thought a
                    quiche needs eggs
                    –
                    and
                    I’ll
                    admit that I might’ve thought so too once upon a time – then this recipe will blow all those ideas
                    out
                    the
                    water.</p>

                <p class="opening">The texture is simply amazing and if you didn’t tell anyone it was vegan, they
                    wouldn’t have a clue!
                    In
                    fact,
                    a
                    quiche loving friend of ours might just have told us that this is even MORE tasty than a regular
                    egg-based
                    quiche. It also has a good amount of protein per slice since we used tofu as our ‘eggs’ in this
                    recipe
                    so
                    this
                    is great for a high protein breakfast or brunch or anytime really.</p>

            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the leek by cutting off the root and the overly fibrous green top. This can be discarded
                        or
                        saved for homemade vegetable stock. Cut the leek in half, wash in between the layers, and then
                        thinly
                        slice.</li>
                    <li>Place a large pan over high heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, and
                        salt,
                        and
                        cook for about 7 minutes, or until there is no moisture in the pan and the leeks have softened.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, add the spinach, crushed bouillon, thyme, parsley, and pepper and cook for about 2
                        minutes, or
                        until the spinach is wilted and no moisture remains in the pan. Note if the mixture is too wet,
                        the
                        inside of the quiche can become soggy. Turn off the heat.</li>
                    <li>Grease a 9½ inch (25 cm) round tart pan, and lay the puff pastry dough in the pan. Gently press
                        the
                        pastry down and up along the sides, just over 1 inch (3 cm) in height.</li>
                    <li>Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the dough and sprinkle the breadcrumbs along the base.
                        Then
                        preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the tofu is sufficiently drained and pressed. If the tofu is too wet, the inside of
                        the
                        quiche can become soggy. To a food processor add the tofu, lemon juice, nutritional yeast,
                        cornstarch,
                        mustard, turmeric, and kala namak salt. Blend until completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the
                        sides as
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Add the blended tofu mixture to the vegetables in the pan and mix together.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the mixture from the pan to the tart pan and spread it out evenly. Rollover any excess
                        pastry
                        dough around the rim to create a crust.</li>
                    <li>Place the halved tomatoes on top, cut side up, and bake on the centre rack of the preheated oven
                        for
                        35
                        - 40 minutes, or until the crust is slightly golden and the top is firm to the touch.</li>
                    <li>Let the quiche cool off for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This time allows the quiche to
                        firm
                        up
                        so it can be cut more cleanly. Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul class="notes">
                    <li>* Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, is a salt often used in South Asian cuisine.
                        The
                        sulphur compounds give the salt an egg-like smell and flavour, which makes it perfect to use in
                        a
                        recipe
                        like this one.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Storage</h4>
                <ul class="storage">
                    <li>The quiche can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
