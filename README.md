# ODIN RECIPES

This is a first The Odin Project project.

The objective is to build basic recipe website using only plain HTML.

By doing this project I learnt basic HTML syntax, I learnt how to make directories, files and navigate through directories using CLI, learnt basic Git commands and how to make repository on GitHub and how to push project to the repository.

#### Odin recipes v2
Added CSS styles.

#### Odin recipes v3
Added Flexbox and responsive desing using media queries.
